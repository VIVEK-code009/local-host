# SkillXCamp

SkillXCamp is a **college-exclusive digital collaboration platform** that allows students to exchange skills, ask for help, and collaborate on projects — all in one focused environment.

Unlike generic social platforms, SkillXCamp is designed **only for college communities** and keeps collaboration simple and distraction-free.

## 🚩 Problem

In colleges today:
- Students struggle to find academic or technical help
- Seniors and mentors are difficult to reach

- Existing tools are either noisy, complex, or too formal

There is **no single, focused platform** built specifically for college-level collaboration.

- A **college-only** collaboration space
- Skill exchange without money
- Structured discussions and project discovery
- Peer-to-peer and senior–junior interaction

# SkillXchange

SkillXchange is a **college-exclusive digital collaboration platform** designed to help students exchange skills, ask for academic or technical help, and collaborate on projects — all in one focused environment.

It brings together the useful aspects of platforms like LinkedIn, Discord, and social media, but is built **specifically for a single college community** and kept simple.

## 🚩 Problem

In colleges today:
- Students struggle to find the right person for help
- Seniors and mentors are difficult to reach
- Project collaboration is unstructured
- Communication is scattered across multiple platforms

Existing tools are either noisy, overly complex, or not designed for student collaboration.

---

## 💡 Solution

SkillXchange provides a **centralized, college-only platform** where students can:
- Exchange skills without money
- Ask questions and get help
- Collaborate on projects and hackathons
- Interact with peers and seniors in one place

The focus is on learning, collaboration, and community — not social noise.
